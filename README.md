# Taskinator
Taskinator is a simple task management application that allows users to add, manage and complete tasks in a board. This project consists of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that work together to create the application.

## Getting Started
To get started with Taskinator, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
Once the index.html file is open, the user can add a new task by clicking on the "Add Task" button, filling out the task name and task type fields, and then clicking "Add Task" again. The new task will appear in the "Tasks To Do" section.

The user can then drag the task to the "Tasks In Progress" or "Tasks Completed" sections as the task progresses. The user can also edit or delete a task by clicking on the corresponding task action button.
